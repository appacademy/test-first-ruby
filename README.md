# Learn Ruby Test-First

## Setup

* Install Ruby
    * You will need Ruby, Bundler, and RSpec
    * We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
    * We officially support Ruby 2.1.2
* Open a terminal window. (On Mac OS X you can use the `Terminal` app.)
* Navigate to the test-first-ruby directory.
* Install RSpec: `bundle install`.

## Using These Exercises

Each exercise has its own spec file in the `spec` directory. Open the
spec file in your favorite text editor to read the directions (we
recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

Each exercise will have you modify a corresponding file in the `lib`
directory.
