# Learn Ruby Test-First

## Setup

If you've already setup ruby, you may skip this step. Otherwise,
please see the [setup instructions][setup] document.

**Note**: You'll need to create a new project. **In Cloud9, where it says "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL", paste
in https://github.com/appacademy/test-first-ruby**.

[setup]: http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/setup

## Using These Exercises

Each exercise has its own spec file in the `spec` directory. Open the
spec file in your favorite text editor to read the directions (we
recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

Each exercise will have you modify a corresponding file in the `lib`
directory.
